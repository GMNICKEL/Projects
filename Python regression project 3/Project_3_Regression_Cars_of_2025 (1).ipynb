        "For this project, I plan to train a model to predict the price of a car based on different specs of said car and then use that model on my dataset at large through use of linear regression. I also plan to experiment with this model by trying to train on different features and how well they help predict the exact prices. To start off, I will use information like horsepower, torque, 0-100mph time, and top speed but plan to also try out different features like number of seats. Just like my last two projects, I will be using the “Cars Datasets (2025)” by Abdul Malik on kaggle.\n",

        "Linear regression in terms of datamining is a way to predict a continuous numerical outcome by modeling its relationship with the other variables in the dataset. So, essentially in my case, I will train my model to predict price (a column from the dataset) based on a number of other columns from the dataset and their relationships to the value of price so that my model can reliably predict the price of a car in the cars 2025 dataset, and maybe even future datasets for 2026.\n",

        "Before diving into my first experiment, I need to understand what I want and how to achieve it. I want to predict prices, simple as that. To achieve it, I will look at the relationship between price and three other columns of my dataset, horsepower, torque, 0-100mph time, and top speed. Based on what I have seen, not only power, but top speed and acceleration seem to correlate well with how expensive a car is. There is no statistical analysis on my part, just observations from using this dataset two other times.\n",

Once that was complete, seeing as I am not using the provided houses dataset, I needed to manually split my dataset 80/20 so I have a decent sample size to work with and train my model on. After the split, the data needed to be cleaned as each column stores strings with symbols by default that make doing math more difficult.\n",

I trained my regression model and then ran some tests, looking at the RMSE as well as a small sample comparing the actual prices vs the predicted prices and the difference between them so I have an idea of how accurate the model is. Overall, I’m pretty happy with the accuracy of the model considering how few columns I used and the fairly small size of the sample used for training.\n",
